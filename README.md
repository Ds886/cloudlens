## Cloudlens - A Sophisticated Command Line Interface for Effortless AWS Service Management!

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87517248/220539848-f20b9791-29f9-4c09-b733-3fdf779d4911.mov

Your One-Stop Terminal Solution for Seamless AWS Service Management and Monitoring! With its intuitive UI and advanced features, it empowers you to effortlessly navigate, observe, and optimize your AWS environment, giving you more time to focus on your core business goals. Whether you're a seasoned cloud expert or just getting started, cloudlens will elevate your AWS experience and take your service management to new heights.

## Note
**Cloudlens reads your ~/.aws/config file, but it does not store or send your access and secret key anywhere. The access and secret key is used only to securely connect to AWS API via AWS SDK.**

**Since cloudlens is in readonly mode, we recommend you create an access and secret key that only has readonly permissions to the AWS services.**

## Features

Our terminal application supports various features, allowing users to view EC2 instances, S3 buckets, EBS volumes, VPCs, SQS queues, Lambda functions, subnets, security groups, and IAM roles, making their work faster and more efficient.

## Documentation

Please refer to our [Cloudlens documentation](https://one2n.gitbook.io/docs/) to know more.

## We appreciate [localstack's](https://localstack.cloud/) assistance with the development
